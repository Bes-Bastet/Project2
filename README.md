# Project2
Project Brief
Weddings. They're so stressful they often undermine the success of the endeavor they were meant to celebrate. This project is designed to help those newly-engaged by helping them face one of the big stressors: choosing an invitation format.

1.  Couples should be able to choose between 3 possible invitation styles. Upon selecting a design, the screen should instantly update with the new look-and-feel
2.  Couples should be provided the appropriate input fields so that they can put in their vital data. Data, as it is entered, should appear inside the currently active look-and-feel.

Note: the data is not submitted to a remote server.

Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
